After wire straightening simulation is finished, one can obtaine permanently deformed shape of the beam based on plastic strain saved in wireStraightener/1 folder. For this purpose it is defined "permanentDeformation" case. In order to calculate permanently deforme shape, one has to performe following preparation steps:

1. Beam dimension (radius and length), discretization and mechanical properties defined in permanentDeformation/constang/beamProperties dictionary must be same as in the wireStraigtener/constang/beamProperties dictionary

2. Run Allrun script

3. If calculation diverges, reduce time step size.

4. Run "gnuplot gpBeamCurvature" to create graph which shows distribution of curvature along beam length.
   According to line "stats [0:1000] './1/beamCurvature.dat' using 1:2 nooutput", mean values will be calculated in the specified range "[0:1000]".
