Procedure for simulating wire straigtening proces:

1. Define positions of all pulleyes in conicalPulleys sub-dictionary in
wireStraightener/constant/beamProperties dictionary.

2. Run "createConicalPulleys" utility to create stl model for all pulleys. Stl model will be saved in wireStraightener/constant/conicalPulleys folder.

3. Run "createConicalPulleysPath L" utility, where L is the length of the patch along right end point of the beam will be pulled through the pulleyes Length L should be equal to length of the wire. Path will be saved in wireStraightener/constant/conicalPulleys folder in two formats: vtk (for visualisation) and simple ascii file for boundary condition.

4. Set length of the beam and number of discretization segments. Recomended length of the segment is around 2 mm.

5. Check following line in the wireStraightener/Allrun script:

moveBeam -cellZone beam_0 -translate "(-1000 23 0)" > log.moveBeam.beam-0

Translation vector "(-1000 23 0)" is defined in such a way so that right end point of the beam is positioned at the begining of the conical pulley patch (see wireStraightener/constant/conicalPulleys/conicalPulleysPath file)

6. Set "velocity" parameter for "fixedPathDisplacement" boundary condition for mean line displacement W at "right" patch. This velocity should be equal to wire length, ie. "velocity 1000".

6. Define tension force applied at the left patch of the wire in wireStraightener/constant/timeVsForce.

6. Set time step size. First guess of the time step size can be obtained using following expression: dt = (rMin*0.025)/velocity, where rMin is radius of the smallest pulley. There is no garangee that convergence will be stable with this time step size. In case of divergence time step size should be reduced.
