# Test case details:

An initially straight beam is subjected to a concentrated moment at the right end.

Details of the test case can be found in the paper: 

A cell-centered finite volume formulation of geometrically exact Simo–Reissner beams with arbitrary initial curvatures, https://doi.org/10.1002/nme.6994

Reference configuration - The beam is straight. 

# Deformed configuration

You can visualise the deformed configuration in paraview by warping the vector using 'pointW' field
