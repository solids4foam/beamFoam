The two test cases are to check the path indepenence of the beam formulation.  This example is taken from Meier's thesis Numerical Example 4, Section 3.8.4, Page 140.

An intially straight cantilever is bent into helix by applying a moment and a small out of plane load. The loads can be applied simulateously or successively. For successive loading, the full moment is first applied in half time and then, the out-of-plane load is applied.

If the formulation is path-independent, then both the successive and simultaneous formulations should give the same deformed beam centreline.
