# Test case details:

An initially straight beam is subjected to a point load at the right end but it follows the deformation of the beam.

The details of this test case is adopted from the paper: 

A three-dimensional finite-strain rod model. part II: Computational aspects 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0045782586900794

Reference configuration - The beam is straight. 

# Deformed configuration

You can visualise the deformed configuration in paraview by warping the vector using 'pointW' field
